          <p class="about-contents">Hello and welcome to my channel! This channel was created with node using the http webserver to handle request! I aspire to create and develop a space on the internet where techie and hacker culture can thrive and flurish -- bridging networking and social media into one platform; based around the spirit of <a class="manifesto" href="http://phrack.org/issues/7/3.html">The Hacker Manifesto</a> and the <a class="hacker-ethic" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_ethic">Hacker Ethic</a> as well. As coding was my most beloved hobby at first; most of my projects and websites presented here were done just for fun. Be sure to head over to libcasa to see some cool stuff my friends and I do for fun! If you are interested in checking out some professional work I have done; check out <a class="k-machine" href="https://kloutmachine.com/">KloutMachine</a> as I work as a front-end web developer here! If you have any questions; please feel free to reach out via any of the methods below! See you later, Space Samurai!</p>
